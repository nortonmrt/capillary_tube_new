# Refrigeration tools
Simple routines to get valuable information for the project of refrigeration systems. There are two main codes, one for determining an estimated length of a capillary tube, and the other one to determine the evaporating and condensing temperatures, given the requirements of the system. Both are detailed below.

## Capillary tube
This routine estimate the length of a capillary tube, for a refrigeration system using R-290 (propane). The input data is:
- Mass flow rate of refrigerant (kg/s);
- Evaporation/condensing pressure (bar);

There are four common capillary diameters already implemented (units in inches). More diameteres can be added by the user, if necessary. The routine evaluate each one of the diameters, getting the smaller one for which the system works properly.

The temperature and thermodynamical properties are given by polynomial curves, generated by Fabio Fortkamp (2022). These curves are only valid for R290, but the coefficients can be changed if necessary.

The mathematical model won't be detailed here, but can be consulted in "Refrigeartion and Air Conditioning" by Stoecker and Jones (McGraw-Hill, 1985), in the chapter of expansion devices. It is important to notice that the theory assumes an adiabatic tube.

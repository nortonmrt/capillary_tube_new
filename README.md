# Capillary Tube
A simple routine to estimate the length of a capillary tube, for a refrigeration system using R-290 (propane). The input data is:
- Mass flow rate of refrigerant (kg/s);
- Evaporation/condensation pressure (bar);
- Diameter of the cappilary tube (can be obtained from datasheets);

The temperature and thermodynamical properties are given by polynomial curves, generated by Fabio Fortkamp (2022). These curves are only valid for R290.

Assuming an adiabatic tube, the
